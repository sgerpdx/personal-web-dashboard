# Software Requirements  

## Vision:  
To create a simple â€˜personal homepageâ€™ web app that allows users to customize a limited variety of features utilizing APIs and a dedicated database for saving bookmarks that can be accessed in any browser.  

### Pain Points Addressed:  
Most web browsers offer access to a search function via the address bar, so the use of a search engineâ€™s website as the homepage is redundant. Additionally, the typical choice of homepage site either bombards the user with excessive algorithm-driven content, are aesthetically impersonal, and/or offer limited customization.  

### Why?  
This app will provide a UX that simultaneously offers a simple solution to saving bookmarks across different browsers and/or devices; and offers increased customization of visual theme, local settings for date/time/weather, and access to an optional news feed.  

## Scope  
  ðŸ – IN: User can...  
  ðŸ ” OUT: The app will...    

### MVP:  
A clock-readout displays the date and time for the userâ€™s region, a simple newsfeed section loads a clickable set of CNN article summaries, and the user can save bookmarks by title and URL, as well as view the list of saved bookmarks. A user account keeps track of user preferences. Display and functionality work in all major browsers â€“ Chrome (desktop/mobile), Safari(desktop/mobile), Firefox, Brave, Vivaldi, Opera, Edge.  

### Stretch Goals: 
Weather information; light/dark visual theme toggle; API picture of the day; editing of bookmarks; editing and saving of personal notes;  

## Non-Functional Requirements:  
Accessibility â€“ App is easy for user to navigate.  
	Visual contrast, aria-labeling, and a mobile-friendly layout that displays effectively on any deviceâ€™s screen.  

Simplicity â€“ Intuitive operation.  
	Features are easy-to-interpret at a glance, and the app is single-page.
